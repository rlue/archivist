Step 1: Sync your Android photo gallery to your computer
--------------------------------------------------------

Use a cloud file sync utility to sync your phone‚Äôs DCIM directory
to an ‚Äúinbox‚Äù directory on your computer.
(I use [Syncthing][], but I imagine that Dropbox works just as well.)

Step 2: Import photos from your ‚Äúinbox‚Äù to your library
-------------------------------------------------------

The easiest way to process the photos that arrive in your ‚Äúinbox‚Äù
is to run photein in a cron job.

```sh
$ crontab -e

    # Run photein once an hour, on the hour
    0 * * * * photein --source ~/Pictures/_inbox --recursive --dest ~/Pictures
```

If polling is not your style, you can build your own script to monitor the
‚Äúinbox‚Äù for changes using inotify. This approach is left as an exercise for
the reader. üòÇ
